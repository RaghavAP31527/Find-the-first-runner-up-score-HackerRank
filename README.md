*This is an explained version of the programme for a hackerrank question*

📝 The `find_second_largest` function takes a list of numbers as input.
2. 🔄 It sorts the numbers in reverse order, putting the largest number first.
3. 🆕 It creates a set called `unique_numbers` to store unique values from the sorted list.
4. 📈 It removes the maximum value from `unique_numbers`, effectively removing the largest number from the list.
5. 📈 Finally, it returns the maximum value in `unique_numbers`, which is now the second largest number.
